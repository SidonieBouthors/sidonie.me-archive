My second reason for making this website was to share some of my recipes online.
I became very interested in cooking during highschool, and I also became vegetarian, 
which pushed me to discover new recipes and techniques I had never seen before.
<br>I continued cooking a lot, especially in the first year of my website, but uploaded very few new recipes.
Even though the template HTML is already built at this point, actually writing a recipe is quite time consuming.
I usually cook intuitively, throwing together the ingredients I have on hand and adapting to them
using the techniques I know. Writing a recipe implies buying all the right ingredients,
measuring out the proportions, cooking times and techniques I use, and writing it all out into clear instructions.
In the context of this website, it also means I have to take pictures of the final dish,
therefore having to create a good presentation and having a good enough background and lighting.
<br> That's why I haven't been able to post many recipes recently, and many of my recipes are outdated in terms
of how I cook these same dishes nowadays.


I built this website mainly to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end web developpement.
                            I built most of it during my last year of highschool, including most of the recipes published here.
                            Now I'm trying to improve it and branch out a bit more : create new content, such as this About Me page,
                            but also improve my CSS, make everything more accessible, and conform better to website best practises.
