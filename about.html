                            So, whether you're here to whip up a delicious meal, dive into coding adventures, 
                            or simply connect with a fellow enthusiast, 
                            I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity and brings a smile to your face.

                            <p>
                             I chose EPFL for its renowned bachelor's programs
                             taught in both French and English, offering a more international 
                             environment compared to traditional French engineering schools. 
                             The university's flexibility enables me to engage in extracurricular 
                             activities, student organizations, and personal projects alongside 
                             my studies. This freedom allows me to tailor my learning experience 
                             to suit my preferences and explore my interests. EPFL's exceptional 
                             academic reputation, combined with its open and adaptable approach, 
                             has made my educational journey fulfilling and enriching.

                            I created this website to learn front-end web development, 
                            specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of it was built 
                            during my last year of high school, including the recipes you 
                            see here. Now, I am focused on expanding its content, improving 
                            my CSS skills, enhancing accessibility, and aligning with best 
                            practices in website development. My aim is to continuously enhance 
                            the user experience and adapt to the evolving web development landscape.

                        <h2>Cooking</h2>
                        <p >Another reason for creating this website was to showcase my favorite 
                            recipes. I became passionate 
                            about cooking during high school, especially after becoming a 
                            vegetarian. Exploring new recipes and techniques became 
                            an interesting challenge.
                            <br>
                            While I continue to cook a lot, I have faced challenges 
                            in regularly uploading new recipes to this website. Writing a recipe 
                            is time-consuming, involving ingredient measurements, cooking times, 
                            and clear instructions. It also requires capturing appealing photographs 
                            with suitable presentation and lighting.
                            <br>
                            As a result, I haven't been able to post many recipes recently, 
                            and some of the existing ones may not reflect my current cooking 
                            style. I appreciate your understanding as I try to balance 
                            maintaining this website with the demands of my time consuming studies.
                            
                            Despite the limited number of recent recipes, I hope the ones I 
                            have shared still inspire you to cook new dishes and try new recipes.
