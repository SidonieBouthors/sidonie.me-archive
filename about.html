                        I built most of it during my last year of highschool, including most of the recipes published here.
                        Now I'm trying to improve it and branch out a bit more : create new content, such as this About Me page,
                        but also improve my CSS, make everything more accessible, and conform better to website best practises.

                    <h2>Cooking</h2>
                    <p >My second reason for making this website was to share some of my recipes online.
                        I became very interested in cooking during highschool, and I also became vegetarian, 
                        which pushed me to discover new recipes and techniques I had never seen before.
                    <br>I continued cooking a lot, especially in the first year of my website, but uploaded very few new recipes.
                        Even though the template HTML is already built at this point, actually writing a recipe is quite time consuming.
                        I usually cook intuitively, throwing together the ingredients I have on hand and adapting to them
                        using the techniques I know. Writing a recipe implies buying all the right ingredients,
                        measuring out the proportions, cooking times and techniques I use, and writing it all out into clear instructions.
                        In the context of this website, it also means I have to take pictures of the final dish,
                        therefore having to create a good presentation and having a good enough background and lighting.
                        <br> That's why I haven't been able to post many recipes recently, and many of my recipes are outdated in terms
                        of how I cook these same dishes nowadays.
