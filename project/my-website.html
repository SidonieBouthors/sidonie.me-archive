            <p>I built this website mainly to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end web developpement. 
                I built most of it during my last year of highschool, including most of the recipes published here. 
                Now I'm trying to improve it and branch out a bit more : create new content, such as 
                the About Me page, but also improve my CSS, make everything more accessible, and conform 
                better to website best practises.</p>
